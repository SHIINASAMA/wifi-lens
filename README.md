# WiFi Lens

**A native open-source network diagnostics app for macOS with built-in Wi-Fi analysis.**

Diagnose connectivity issues, analyze Wi-Fi channel congestion, and validate roaming behavior — with results processed locally on your Mac.

**Open source for live analysis. Pro adds monitoring, history, and insights for problems that happen over time.**

### Available in Pro

| Capability | What it helps you do |
|------------|----------------------|
| 📈 Event Timeline *(Preview)* | Reconstruct when connections roamed, dropped, or changed signal |
| 📋 Statistics *(Preview)* | Compare Wi-Fi behavior across periods instead of relying on memory |
| 💡 Insights *(Preview)* | Turn recorded evidence into explainable findings |
| 🎬 Spectrum Recording | Replay spectrum changes after an intermittent problem |
| 📱 Menu Bar | Keep monitoring reachable without opening the main window |

## When you need Pro

Use Open Source to inspect and diagnose your Wi-Fi right now.

Choose Pro when the problem happens over time:

- Connection drops or slowdowns are intermittent
- You need to reconstruct when roaming or signal changes happened
- You want to compare network behavior across periods
- You want to record spectrum conditions and replay them later
- You want findings that explain recorded evidence

**Open Source helps you inspect. Pro helps you monitor and investigate.**

---

## Editions

Choose based on how you use WiFi Lens:

- **Open Source** — free, inspect and diagnose your Wi-Fi now, available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SHIINASAMA/wifi-lens/releases/latest)
- **WiFi Lens Pro** — one-time purchase, monitor and investigate over time, available from [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6776590746?pt=128979395&ct=github_readme&mt=8)

| Capability | Open Source | WiFi Lens Pro |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Live Wi-Fi analysis | ✅ | ✅ |
| Network diagnostics | ✅ | ✅ |
| Channel recommendations | ✅ | ✅ |
| Event history | — | ✅ |
| Historical statistics | — | ✅ |
| Wi-Fi insights | — | ✅ |
| Spectrum recording | — | ✅ |
| Menu bar monitoring | — | ✅ |

> Both editions are local-first. Pro extends the workflow from live inspection to monitoring and investigation over time.

## AI / MCP Integration

WiFi Lens includes an embedded MCP server that lets AI assistants read your local Wi-Fi data. Enable it in Settings, then choose **Copy AI setup prompt** and paste the prompt into an MCP-compatible desktop client such as Codex Desktop or Claude Desktop.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wifi-lens": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:19840"
    }
  }
}
```

For manual setup, use the format your client expects:

```toml
# Codex: ~/.codex/config.toml
[mcp_servers.wifi-lens]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:19840/"
```

```json
// Claude Desktop and other JSON-based clients
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wifi-lens": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:19840/"
    }
  }
}
```

Once connected, ask your assistant things like *"What channels are congested near me?"* or *"Which nearby networks support WPA3?"*. The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only — nothing leaves your machine unless you deliberately route it elsewhere.

See the [AI Workflows guide](https://wifi-lens.shiinalabs.com/ai-mcp/) for more examples.

### Investigate problems after they happen

Some Wi-Fi problems disappear before you can inspect them. WiFi Lens Pro records connection events and network conditions over time, so you can review what happened after a drop, roam, or signal change.

## Privacy

WiFi Lens does not collect usage analytics, crash telemetry, or Wi-Fi scan data.

- **Location Services:** macOS requires this permission to expose Wi-Fi SSID names. WiFi Lens does not read GPS position.
- **Region detection:** Uses system locale, hardware-reported channel list, and nearby AP country codes on-device.
- **Network Self-Check:** Resolves public endpoints (`www.apple.com`, `www.msftconnecttest.com`) and may test reachability of configured proxy endpoints.
- **MCP server:** Binds to `127.0.0.1` only. Local tools access data only after you enable it.
- **Update checks:** The GitHub edition contacts GitHub when you request an update check or enable automatic checks.
